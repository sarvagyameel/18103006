Depth of anaesthesia (DOA) monitors has been introduced to provide the information about the state of patient. It has not been possible to develop a system capable of quantifying the analgesia. So, to minimize the effect of pain due to skin incision on a patient, it is required to find some correlation between pain stimuli due to skin incision and EEG signal.","https://pec.ac.in/coe/ongoing-projects"

<p>,"Loss of teeth results in significant disabilities, which can disrupt social activities. Men and women of all ages are self-conscious about their dentures, bridges or missing tooth. Some have difficulty speaking because their dentures slip or click. Moreover, they feel aged before time due to tooth loss. A number of options exist for the replacement of missing teeth. The most recent of these is dental implants. Dental implants offer an excellent alternative to the limitations of conventional dentures, bridges and missing teeth. Patient suffering from tooth loss having limited bone to support the implant and needs accurate placement due to adjacent anatomical structures.","https://pec.ac.in/coe/ongoing-projects"
<p>,"Dental drill guides are the solution to these problems. There have been many advances in the field of implant dentistry that have improved the success and predictability of implant placement. One such advancement is the use of dental drill guides. These guides have allowed surgeons to place implants in areas where there is limited bone, and in locations where adjacent anatomical structures require accurate placement. This has improved patient care by allowing implant placement in areas that may have otherwise required grafting and additional surgeries. The major problem reported in the use of dental drill guides is rise in bone temperature which further results in series of problems.","https://pec.ac.in/coe/ongoing-projects"

<p>,"Maxillofacial prostheses are usually fabricated on the basis of conventional impressions and techniques. The extent to which the prosthesis reproduces normal facial morphology depends on the clinical judgment and skill of the individual fabricating the prosthesis. Recently, as a result of advances in technology, various computer-aided design and additive manufacturing techniques such as Fused Deposition Modelling have been successfully introduced for the automated fabrication of maxillofacial prostheses. These systems are able to provide more consistently accurate reproduction of facial morphology . Potential problems associated with conventional impressions include patient discomfort and distortion of the facial soft tissues. Also, the conventional technique available requires the technician to spend time carving and adapting the prosthesis to a cast of the deficient side of the face. Hence, these techniques rely upon the skill and individual ability of the technician. Due to the digitized imaging technology, it has become possible to obtain noncontact three-dimensional facial measurements and three-dimensional anatomic model which is more accurate and low in price.","https://pec.ac.in/coe/ongoing-projects"

<p>,"Effects of Micro -breaks in Prolonged Sitters","https://pec.ac.in/coe/ongoing-projects"
<p>,"Sitting down at work could be contributing to weight gain and increase our risk of developing serious diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer . Regular short bursts of movement reduces these risks and may also boost performance. Long periods of time spent sitting is bad for our health and bad for concentration, because we often underestimate the number of hours we spend sitting in work everyday. Studies done internationally indicate that prolonged sitting leads to multiple diseases such as MSD, Type II Diabetes, CVD. In India the Banking & IT sector having large number of jobs related to prolonged sitting and has a very high incidence of the referred diseases, and sedentary habits related to work environment has not been studied. No attempt has been made to understand this by policy makers or the industry . Prolonged sitting culture is becoming prevalent in modern days which is an example of unhealthy workplace, we must change our sedentary lifestyle. As more occupations in the IT & Banking sector call for long periods of sitting down, it is crucial to encourage people to look for opportunities to get up and move at work. In addition to reducing our risk of developing serious diseases, the performance benefits are considerable:- reducing our risk of developing serious diseases, the performance benefits are considerable:-better concentration, more energy, less fatigue. No one would dispute the benefits of exercising regularly, however this typically happens outside the workplace, where we spend ever more time sitting. Research shows that regular exercise does not offset completely the negative health effects of prolonged sitting.","https://pec.ac.in/coe/ongoing-projects"

The first Education Commission (1950) recommended the introduction of national service by students on a voluntary basis, but NSS was officially included in the curriculum for University students, along with National Sports Organization (NSO) and National Cadet Corps (NCC), after the Conference of State Education Ministers in April 1967.","https://pec.ac.in/nss"

<p>,"All classes are to be held as per announced time-table. The time table of an individual faculty member must be displayed outside his/her room and also on the website (standard format available with Webmaster for uploading). No scheduled class should be left unengaged. If a class has to be rescheduled due to certain reasons, it must be done with prior intimation to the HOD and the students, about the alternate class. Even in emergencies (medical or otherwise), it is the responsibility of a faculty member to inform the HOD or his office by telephone/messenger of the re-scheduling of a class. This information must also reach the students. Normally a class should commence within 5 minutes of the starting time and should finish not earlier than 5 minutes before end time. Only in rare cases, say once or twice a semester, may a class be disengaged more than 5 minutes before the end-time. Tutorials and practical classes must also be engaged as scheduled.

They observed that Sr doping in BiFeO3 showed substantial reduction in the leakage current whilst co-doping with Sr and Mn led to lower reduction in the leakage current through offering better performance over undoped BiFeO3, due to changes brought in the defect physics upon doping. Additionally, Sr and Mn co-doped BiFeO3 samples exhibit enhanced magnetization in comparison to undoped and Sr doped BiFeO3, possibly due to interruptions in the spin cycloid of BiFeO3.","https://pec.ac.in/events/dr-sanjeev-kumar-pec-india-2020-top-cited-paper-award"

His golden rule, he stated, was that he believed in making many mistakes, but he’d rather err while experimenting than practicing. He too recognized the fact that providing a good student experience was paramount above all things. He then talked about how India still follows a science-based education system which is out of touch with our time and requirements. His speech was supplemented by Dr. Dutta. He opened his speech with a remarkable idea of ‘Free and Unrestricted Choice for Education’ and emphasized on continuous self-evaluation as a key to success. His main idea was that the University should take examples from other institutions, but never try to copy or clone them, the variance that a University provides over other institution is what attracts people. He also stated his idea about restructuring the M.Tech programs and provide more focus on them. His ideas to promote the entrepreneurship and start-ups in India were vivid and he highlighted the errs in using the ranking system for colleges and how they may be inaccurate and might lose their purpose.","https://pec.ac.in/events/98th-foundation-day"

N Sharma, Associate Professor, Department of Applied Sciences, PEC University of Technology has been awarded a project as Co-PI with research grant of Rs 21 Lakh to study snow and glaciers. It is a cluster of multi-institutional national networked project. Dr Sharma happens to be among top researchers who have been selected from prestigious organisations of national repute like IIT- Bombay, Kanpur, Chennai, Kharagpur, IIST-ISRO, DTRL, DRDO, IARI and Central Universities etc it said. It will involve 4 Region-wise central laboratory facilities which will also maintain data acquired. The IIT- Bombay has been identified as national nodal agency to coordinate and maintain data portal of the project through setting up a coordination cell. Total duration of the project is 3 years. The project involves characterization of physical and optical properties of different forms of snow and glaciers using ground truth data collection and remote sensing techniques, he pointed out. The physical process analysis of snow features will provide crucial information to understand and model the snow physical parameters. This will help in creating a data base of such processes from field input and up scaling them on satellite data and thus will help in better understanding of snow and glacier formation. The major beneficiaries of the output of the project will be Army, BRO, DRDO, Deptt of Space Labs, MoEF, MoES, Hydroelectric Energy Producers, Agriculture operators etc. Having second project on glaciers to his credit, Dr Sharma is involved in paleoclimatic studies of glaciers (Hamtah and Siachin) for more than a decade is opined that west Himalayan glaciers are definitely retreating due to global warming. Right from its origin i.e 4600 million years earth had five ice ages. The variations in the Earth’s orbit and shifting plate tectonics spur the waxing and waning of these periods. At present we are living in the interglacial warmer period, hence geologically speaking there is nothing abnormal about global warming. However, anthropogenic forcing from increased greenhouse gases and intensive use of fossil fuels have alarmed the situation to such an extent that human beings own existence is at stake.","https://pec.ac.in/events/pec-professor-bags-dst-sponsored-research-project-snow-and-glaciers-studies"
